# Rebuild edited section only

After any **code** edit, refresh the running stack on this machine — but **only** for the section(s) you changed. Close and remove the current version of that section first, then build and run a fresh one. Do **not** use Vite hot reload / HMR.

**Both API and WebUI must be running** after the turn. Rebuild only what changed; if the other side is down, start it without a redundant rebuild.

## Detect section from edits

| Section | Typical paths | Refresh |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **API** | `netvan-api` handlers, routes, RPC, WS, collectors, config, deps, crates (except pure DB schema — see DB) | Reinstall Windows service only |
| **DB** | `netvan-api/**/db.rs`, schema SQL, live SQLite under the API data dir | Update DB only |
| **WebUI** | `netvan-webui` (`src/`, Vite config, UI assets) | Stop, rebuild, cold-run WebUI only |

Multiple sections in one turn → run each matching refresh once. Still skip rebuild for sections with no edits.

## API — close/remove, then fresh install

When API binary code changed:

```powershell
# From netvan-api root; requires Administrator
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\reinstall-windows-service.ps1
```

Order: build → stop → `uninstall` (remove old) → `install` → `start` + `status`. Do not only stop/start. Do not rebuild WebUI for API-only edits — but confirm WebUI is still listening; start it if it is down.

## DB — update DB only

When only DB/schema or live SQLite data changed:

1. Prefer applying the schema/data change without rebuilding WebUI.
2. Schema lives in the API binary (`db.rs` `SCHEMA`, applied on DB open). Shipping new schema code requires an API reinstall (same script as above) so the new `SCHEMA` runs — still **do not** rebuild WebUI unless WebUI also changed.
3. Pure live-DB data fixes (SQL against `netvan-web.db` / data dir): change the DB only; do not reinstall API or rebuild WebUI unless those also changed.
4. Do not wipe the DB unless the user explicitly asked for a reset.
5. Confirm both API and WebUI are running afterward.

## WebUI — stop, rebuild, cold run (no hot reload)

When WebUI code changed:

1. Stop and remove the current WebUI process (whatever is bound to `127.0.0.1:8001`). Do not rely on HMR.
2. From `netvan-webui`: `npm run build`
3. Start a fresh server on the usual port, e.g. `npx vite preview --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001` (or project-equivalent cold serve on `8001`)
4. Never uninstall/reinstall the API service for WebUI-only edits — but confirm the API service is running; reinstall/start it only if it is down and the user needs the stack.

## Always leave both running

Before saying the change is live:

1. API: service `status` shows installed and running (or listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`)
2. WebUI: listening on `127.0.0.1:8001`
3. If a section was not rebuilt this turn but its process is down, start that section only (no extra rebuild of the other)

## When not to refresh

1. Docs-only, comments-only, or unused files (still ensure both are running if the user will test)
2. That section’s refresh already succeeded this turn for the same change
3. User said do not reinstall / foreground debug only for the API service
